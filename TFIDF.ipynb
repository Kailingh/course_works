As we waited and finally got up to the menu , the order taker informed u that they were only accepting cash at the moment . My driver decided to exit the line but I insisted on getting him a meal . I risked life and limb to get that man dinner . I agree with the other reviewer that this place is le that satisfactory . The cashier wa not even the slightest bit delightful in my ordering experience . The restaurant did not look very clean . The employee were arguing about something very loudly that made me a bit uncomfortable . Anyway , I got the food and got out of there ASAP !

BIG MISTAKE ! ! 1ST of all Once they speak it seems like they have an attitude . they dont even greetYou with good customer service and huff and puff a if they are in a rush to take your Order . 2nd when I ordered the wing for my girlfriend they said `` it gon na be A 20 minute wait after you pay '' are they serious they cant start on my orderRight away once I place it ? ? ! ! There wa 3 car in front of me so I have to waitEven longer ? ? ? So I said no thank you we will just order something else and thereWe hear another deep breathe a if im taking very long to place my order . Then after I placed my order we stood in line with 3 car still in front of u so we waited patiently.After waiting 15mins and no car ha moved and 2 car behind u left the line we decided to go to the McDonald 's on cicero and 28th where they have great customer service , everything on the menu available and we dont have to wait 20-40Minutes for our food ... the McDonald 's on 3200 w Roosevelt is the worse place anyone can go to for food.. Before I left today the cashier at the window looked my way and of course I stopped and told her the I wa going to write a review on yelp and she laughed and said `` yeah okay boo do you '' unbelievable I dont understand how these people still have their job ! ! ! Please tell me which McDonald 's allows their employee to play loud music while at work ? This place wa very very ghetto and I seriously dont recommend for anyone to stop at this location ! ! !

I 've seen some pretty bad place , but this place took the cake in term of filth and vagrancy because the place seemed to be a location for people to loiter around in and having people up in there begging for change and all while you 're trying to order your food . I wa waiting with my fiance for his food to come up and the guy behind the counter wa banging his hand saying `` can I help the next customer '' ... ..really you think you can get someone 's attention banging your hand on the counter like some ignorant fool with no professional standard . Who would want to eat in this place with folk standing outside trying to sell you stuff and this one guy wa begging for change to allegedly feed his baby sister ... ..that 's so typical for them to sit there and lie because they want someone to give them money so they can feed their whatever habit they 're trying to hide . This restaurant is situated in one of the most ghetto neighborhood on the west side which say how the standard ha gone down . If they really cared they would keep the restaurant clean inside and outside and I wa glad that I did n't see the inside of the bathroom because if it 's a ghetto McDonalds the bathroom wouldnt exactly look like they were maintained well either . I wouldnt bother eating here unless you want to be harassed by goofy hoodrats and crack fiend looking for someone to give them change . I can think of at least 10 McDonalds location that ha staff that do n't look like they were plucked from the ghetto garden because this McDonalds seems to employ hoodrats and ghetto snot to work at this particular location . I have gotten much better service elsewhere than this place I wo n't be coming here again and I want to be served by someone who can properly wear a hairnet that 's not the length of the hairstyle and doesnt look like a hoodrat with multi colored dragon lady tip a mile long . \",\n",

Yes , yes , it is unhealthy , but sometimes you just want that extra wink of sleep or two ! Over the year and a half span of working in this area , I hit the drive-thru up perhaps a dozen time . Out of those twelve visit , about half of them had issue with my order.Here are the issue I can remember : * Smaller sized smoothie than I paid for* Not including ketchup when requested* Not including hot sauce when requested* Not including napkin when requested ( yes , people eat out of their car ! ) * Giving me someone else 's orderThose are just the issue I remembered , but there were probably others . I never actually went inside to complain , a these pit stop were right before I had to open my business in the morning . With a 50-50 chance of getting your order right , that just seems poor listening skill . I hope the management take note of this.If you do want a better sit-down breakfast or lunch , try the JK 's restaurant about two block east on Wolf and Saint Charles . You 'll get much better service here , providing you have the time to sit down and enjoy it . \",\n",

This one is a double drive thru ... I left twice now without an order taken because I wa waiting in the drive thru for someone to take my order but they took other car order first who were not even there when I first got there .

Upon entering this establishment I came upstairs n their varied many and perused the item hoping upon hope that they had Foie gras a I had a taste for the liver of a goose . It wa not to be found . They must be animal right activist that run this establishment . I asked the young girl at the counter what their speciality wa and she told me the Big Mac wa one of their finer dish . I placed the order along with some French fry , I no longer call them freedom fry now that the French have come fully on board with our war against Muslim country # jesuischarlie I wonder how these French fry will be served , I am imagining they will be garnished with black truffle . I ask for their wine list and am told they do not have one . How peculiar for a restaurant that serf French food . To my horror no baguette either . My food bill come to 6.30 cent . Imagine that , the Big Mac meal , their finest offering and it is only just over 6 dollar . The wait is not long for my entree , so glad I did not ask for their freedom onion soup . Strangely the food is in a box and a carton . This must be a new style , the creativity of chef these day know no bound . I am impressed . I open up the box and there lie this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dressing on it . It is cold and damp . This must be an artistic statement of some kind . Possibly a commentary on the ill treatment of the Intuit native at the turn of the last century . I am impressed by the chef social concern but I had wished that the food wa hot . I took a bite . I am glad that I sat close to the toilet a I made a run for it . They must have been upset that I ordered the foie gras originally . They are making me pay for it . I know when I have been defeated . My pomme frites were hot but lacking any French accoutrement . This must be French cooking under the Vichy government when the Germans took away their cream and tried to make them eat sausage . Completely defeated I made my way to the exit sign a I heard a cackle of teenage girl laughing at me a I tripped over the yellow wet floor alert signal . This is the last time I will ever eat in a French restaurant again . Perhaps I should have ordered the escargot . ',\n",

Cars behind me gave their order when I wa told to go to the window to give mine because the register were n't working . Person behind me drove right off with their order while I 'm waiting for an order for one . Was not even told my total at the window . Does n't have friendly worker working the drive thru .

IF ANYTHING wa to go down , hurry to this refuge of safety.This following rant is not on this specific location but on McDs in general . What the hell is a friggin ' McDouble and why is it replacing the double cheeseburger for 99c ? A McDouble is a fancy way of saying `` we jacked yo cheeze , foo !

'' You do n't mind , do you ? '' We decided to go through drive through instead hoping for faster service . We got to the speaker and the employee asks `` What do you want ? '' Not a `` How can I help you '' or anything semi-customer service oriented . We decided to order anyway because my daughter wa really excited for some fry . Otherwise we would have left at this point . We placed our order and then pulled up to pay . She told u one amount and then ended up giving me change for another amount . However , I did n't happen to check it until I had pulled up to the next window . We pulled up to get our order at the 2nd window and the employee asked u what we had ordered . Not just an item or two so she could make sure we were the next order , but she wanted to know everything we had ordered . I 'm not sure why there wa an issue in relaying the information from the 1st window to the 2nd ( especially with computer ) . The 2nd window employee wa nice and even wished u a good day . The order wa right and the fry were hot . Upon looking at the receipt , the cashier did give me the correct change she just said the wrong amount . When it come to ordering , it really bother me when you walk into a restaurant that ha their breakfast menu up even though they say they are not serving breakfast anymore . Inside the breakfast menu wa up , but they told others they were not serving it anymore . In the drive thru , we asked ( just in case because I really wanted a sausage biscuit ) but they said again they were n't serving breakfast . The biggest problem with this wa that because the breakfast menu were up the lunch menu were not and you would have had to know exactly what you wanted to get . We ended up getting the basic : fry , hamburger , drink . ( I do n't have the number meal memorized , and I swear they are different at each McDonalds . ) Overall the service wa slow and the employee were rude . It wa not busy during our visit .

As some other reviewer have said , the staff have no control over it and it turn into a free-for-all . I honestly think Chicago PD need to have a few officer staffed inside this place 24/7 , since there are always a lot of sketchy thing going on . I 'm surprised no one ha been stabbed and/or shot.Even if you are just passing by , you will immediately know something is up with this place . There are no le than 20 strange character loitering outside of it pretty much all day , making weird comment at stranger . Again , it 's nothing short of a miracle that people have n't been stabbed or shot here . I make it a point to walk past a quickly a possible and not make eye contact since the people loitering out front always give me weird look and act like they want to fight.Seriously , if this place got bulldozed tomorrow morning I do n't think anyone would shed a tear and the adjacent building ' property value would quadruple . Businesses like this are the reason Yelp need negative stars.Also , I LOL 'd at the photo making this look like a classy place . It is not . \",\n",

It seems that this McDonald 's is marketed to the commuter exiting the subway and driving on Chicago Street with it giant arch hanging above the subway exit at Chicago Street . The result is that this McDonald 's is busy . Even outside there are usually people hanging out , including the homeless . This Mcdonald 's is relatively large . There wa no problem getting a table . And there wa breathing room . Because this McDonald 's is busy and the employee were overworked while being on the friendly side , I will not dwell on the fact that they forgot my order and napkin . I will just knock off half a star . This McDonald 's is convenient , and relatively inexpensive . Whether it one or five star , the convenience and ample seating make up for the flaw .

       " \"Today wa the breaking point . Long ago , McDonald 's revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining , a paragon of what wa possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline process and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time . These day , efficiency no longer matter and ha been replaced with indifference , complacency , and a lack of disregard to customer priority . On most morning , I will stop into McDonald 's to grab a yogurt parfait for $ 1.12 a my morning breakfast . I did it because it wa a healthy breakfast , tasted good , and wa amazingly cheap . Before today , one of the top ten thing I associate with McDonald 's is efficiency , and today I can throw that word out the window because McDonald 's no longer merit it.Today I left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because I did n't have dinner and I wa short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work . I arrived at 8:44am and I know this because Foursquare told me so when I checked in ! Something wa amiss and there wa a large crowd of people and line that were simply not moving.Great , these thing sometimes happen , which wa why I wa glad that I left my house early so that if I actually did have to wait in line it would n't matter and I 'd still be able to get what I wanted when I wanted it . The minute started flying by and the line still wa n't moving ! What happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy ? Well you can all forget about it because it 's clear that no one in this McDonald 's during the morning shift give one iota of care for anyone waiting in line.I got to be the third person in line when two customer started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in . The clerk would n't make a new coffee for the customer and the customer were n't having any of it . Watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because I wa trying to get an order in and get to work on time ! Because of the inability of the clerk to placate these customer I ended up stuck in line waiting , waiting , and waiting in what seemed to be forever ! Having arrived at 8:44am , it wa now 8:54am and I had n't made an order ! I yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patron who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat . I slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to Starbucks . At Starbucks I spent $ 5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food - $ 5 I could have easily spent at McDonald 's in order to get what I wanted , but apparently McDonald 's no longer care about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customer and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food . Long gone are the good old day of the quick food restaurant , this McDonald 's no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and ha degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency .

When the staff ring up your receipt , they do nothing but look on in fatigue at their own reflection , and observe a strange sense of love , from cold comfort in the scratched up , `` stained-less '' steel counter tops.To the CDC : save a life , and look twice -- the dirt and trained monkey might have escaped from the same lab and work somewhere inside . The only thing fresh in this place is what will be on the toilette paper the next day a a result of the oil that , I imagine , wa obtained from an underworld market exchange fashioned by cheap cost and the flesh of missing person .

Now for the bad news : high volume McDonalds have been trying different line workflow for the last six month , at least at this location and the one in Union Station , and with the recent automation implemented you can expect to wait 10 minute for a cup of coffee . As another review said , it 's probably because it doe seem like chaos to stand in a line 2-3 deep , place your order , and then step aside in front of the people who ordered before you , so the person fulfilling the order can shuttle to the counter & back delivering your bag of food . This actually got you your food pretty quickly , even in peak times.So now the newest system is a single register to take order , and an electronic system that show order number that are ready on a TV screen . Sounds great , right ? Not at this location . For some reason their fulfillment process is very very slow . It took 10 minute the other day for my order to come up , and with the old system , it would be 2-3 minute consistently , I think it wa faster because there were four individual team working on fulfilling order , not a centralized mainly single-threaded process with the new system.This morning I walked in , saw the line in front of the register wa 2 deep , and 20 people were waiting for their order ( 20 ! ) . This is n't DeKalb where a busload of people just walked in .

I ca n't count the number of time I have been here where I stand in line at a register and when I finally get to the front the person is running around without any clear direction running food to other register for the people who arrived after me but were lucky enough to win the register lottery . Multiple time I have had to get someone 's attention and remind them that I am still waiting to place my order.It 's not rocket science . Heck , it 's not even science . It 's service . Plain and simple . Divide and conquer : one group of people take order and another group of people run the food while yet another make it in the back . Sounds simple , right ? Well it doe n't appear so simple when you walk into this McDonald's.I have worked in the food service industry a a waiter and I understand that people have different idea on what is good service but one thing is always constant : greet your customer and communicate with them . Let them know if you 'll be a minute ; inform them if there 's a wait . Whatever the issue just let them know ; they 'll appreciate you more for it and be more willing and patient to wait.Other than the service this is , well , McDonald 's . Does n't matter which one you go to you get pretty much the same thing . That 's the hallmark of their business . The only difference is service.So , pay attention franchisees : McDonald 's may continue to get my money but you independent franchise owner may soon lose valuable customer with poor service.Afterall , there 's a McDonald 's within a couple mile just about anywhere in developed country . \",\n",

All thing being fair , the culinary experience wa doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstance I wo n't get into here.Upon stepping to the counter , I gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a McDonald 's Express , which is a new concept to me all-together . I decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fry and drink aka `` The Value Meal '' . My meal wa served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server . The food seemed to appear from nowhere - gremlin cooking the food ? I could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrapper . At this point I made a snap substitution request , no coke , coffee instead - a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother . My server obligated me in silence and I acknowledged her generosity . I took my tray and chose a seat by the front window where parked car would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlight , but at least it wa somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restaurant.I sat down and emptied the content of the bag , fry and napkin , no ketchup . I tasted one of the fry to determine if they were worthy of ketchup-free consumption , but ala no , they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat . I fetched several ketchup packet from the server , kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my table.Spilling out the ketchup packet on the table , I noticed dried droplet of ketchup on the plastic packet . No turning back now , I dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself . So , to sum up : Fries . They left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette . Perhaps they co-mingled food in the fryer . The luke-warm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down . Maybe some beer would have helped the process.Cheeseburgers . Lifting the top bun of any burger , you can tell right away if there wa any love in the preparation . Though consumable , the burger were not satisfying and tasted a if they sat under a heat lamp for too long , also lukewarm.Coffee . I have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room . It wa watery , lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffee.Ketchup Packets . Looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchup.Customer Service .

The last time I went though they ran out of Canadian bacon for the egg McMuffin which wa on sale buy one get one free and instead of allowing me to get another sandwich in it place I wa just told I had to order something else.I thought that wa wrong since they are the one that could n't keep up with demand !

       " \"So my first experience with this McDonald 's wa the day that I moved in . I had a couple friend helping me . This McDonald 's is directly across the street from my apartment.So , after witnessing a guy smash his van ( we later were told by the po-po that it wa stolen ) into the light pole right at the corner , then watching him exit the vehicle and run maniacly down North Ave. , away from the scene , we decided we were hungry . We thought `` why not go to McD 's '' . Seems logical . I mean , McD 's is always the same no matter where you go , right ? And it wa certainly conveniently located . At least it appears conveniently located . Oh , it not . Attempting to cross North Ave. at my intersection is really a situation where you are taking your life into your hand . This is a 4 , 5 , 6 , oh hell , I do n't even know how many corner there are here , intersection . And one of the light is only green for one side of the street , but ha no sign indicating that anywhere , so people either do n't stop or just stand there . You feel like you are playing Frogger . Except not with a pixellated frog , but rather with your own skin and organs.If you make it into the building with your spinal cord still attached to your body , you will see they always have at least 15 people working here . Yet , there are never more than 2 register open at once . And the only people working those register are either a. ancient , non-english speaking woman b. mentally handicapped . Hey , I appreciate their sense of social responsibility to hire the old and degenerate . I do not appreciate the game of charade I must play with the cashier to get my order right.While you are waiting the 15 plus minute it take to get your food here , you may notice that this McDonalds is a bit different from the rest . Ricky Martin picture , signed Selena CDs and gigantic Enrique Iglesias are the decor of choice here . Apparantly , this is the Latin Rock n ' Roll McDonalds . Couple that with the fact that it the only McDonald 's I have ever seen that ha Jalepeno 's a a condiment and the fact that they look at me a if I am lost every time I walk in there , I think it safe to say the clientele here is pretty set.Overall , the location , service and neighborhood suck . I would give it only 1 star , but hey , it open 24-7 and it McDonalds . \",\n",
       " 'At a time when people are finally realizing that we must eat healthy to be healthy McDonalds make no move away from their overly processed junk food .

       " \"Never thought I 'd write a review about a McDonald 's , but I feel compelled . This one wa just re-built , replacing a perfectly servicable old one . Whatever , it 's their money.My problem with the new one is that it parking lot configuration and ease of ingress/egress is even more stupid than the old one , if that 's possible . You see , if you 're coming from the east , entrance into the lot , either via entrance on North Avenue or Lowell ( one way north ) , is no problem . If you 're coming from the west on North Avenue ( or from the south on Kostner ) , you literally can not enter the parking lot . At all . I thought by turning left onto Kostner ( a fairly main-drag kind of street ) , I could enter ( a you could with the old one ) . Nope . No entrance any more on Kostner . And you can not turn left from North Avenue to Lowell because there 's a median ( I think : either way , you 're risking an accident or a ticket ) . There 's an alley directly behind the lot , which is not only fenced off from Mickey D 's , but 'one way ' going out . So I drive AROUND THE BLOCK , past Lowell ( the one-way street next to McDonald 's ) , to Kildare , back to North Avenue , then enter . Jesus . The entrance ha one of those divided-curb thingys , which wa barely wide enough for my compact car . There are TWO drive-thru lane from which to order food , but then they merge into one waiting line , so you can end up in this single line ahead of someone who 's been waiting longer , or vice-versa , so why bother ? The rest wa standard McDonald 's ( WHY ca n't you at least offer me salsa for my breakfast burrito ? ) ... .I got no sauce , no ketchup , no napkin , nuthin'.OK , then to get out and go back east on North Avenue , you must basically repeat the maze-bullshit from above , only in the reverse . You used to be able to exit onto Kostner , then turn left on North Avenue . Now you are forced to either go west on Grand or North Avenue or go to Lowell , north to Wabansia ( past a high school ) to Kildare to North Avenue . Got all that ? Apparently the city think it 's more desirable for u to drive around an entire neighborhood than to use the only ( inexplicably ) one-way alley in the entire neighborhood to get home from fucking McDonald 's . I felt like rat in a ghetto-maze , only with a soon-to-be-cold Egg McMuffin.So in a nutshell , if you live west of here , you ca n't get in . If you live east of here , you ca n't get out . And ya ca n't really go north , either . It 's maddening . If you must go to THIS McDonald 's , walk or take the bus , seriously . From my house ( at the halfway point between the two ) , I will just go down to the one at Kedzie/North . I realize McDonald 's and/or the city are trying to protect themselves from lawsuit from our shitty driving , and that badly designed intersection , but if it 's that dangerous ( which it is ) then just DO N'T BUILD IT THERE . It 's a square lot , yet needlessly complicated . Grrr . \",\n",

It wa like 130am and the drive thru wa packed with car , they had u wait ... who know for which item because we did n't get anything unusual . We sat & sat & sat ... .as car after car passed u & left . We think they may have forgotten about u . Finally , I wanted Sweet & Sour sauce for nuggies & it wa noted on the screen ... Yet I got BBQ sauce . 'T wa a sad situation to eat with a sauce I do n't like while scarfing down the food with my buddy in the parking lot . hehe Based on my experience & the other review , avoid this location . However , if it 's late night & you 're feening for some nuggies , this location is 24 Hours so it may be your only option ! \",\n",
       " \"Standard run-of-the-mill McDonald 's . They all kind of blur together for me . The only reason why this one stood out at all for me wa the fact that the Drive-thru take forever.I wa seriously , not-kidding , in line for about 15 minutes.Which is why I had enough time to check-in , and start my review for this place ... Bully for them.At least it 's not a bad a the McDonald 's off of Dundee and Rand -- by the Home Depot . That one always mess up order , are rude , and when they had the Monopoly piece -- they actually REMOVED the piece from my brother 's meal . Absurd ! \",\n",
       " 'The Hamburglar actually workz the drive thru . Because all I heard wa rubble-rubble ! ',\n",
       " \"This place is terrible . We went through the drive thru and ordered a value meal and a wrap . They gave u the drink and the bag , which we assumed contained everything . When we got home , we found both the wrap and the receipt missing . My boyfriend returned , fuming , and when he asked for the missing wrap , he wa denied because he did n't have the receipt ! The receipt they never gave u ! He had to buy a new wrap . We 're never returning here again . \",\n",
       " 'What can we expect from McDonalds LOL LOL LOL ! ',\n",
       " \"These guy really do suck . They 're in such a hurry to get you through the place that they really do n't care if your order is right . We just drove through and the only thing they did get right wa the bill . Check your bag before you leave the window ! ! \",\n",
       " \"Worst McDonald 's I 've ever been to . Slow and Incompetent staff ! I 've been to this McDonald 's 3 time since it is right by my house and each time wa a very bad experience . This ca n't be a coincidence where every experience wa poor . I went inside to order and each time took 10 to 20 minute to get my order . 2 out of the 3 time other customer complained because the staff forgot something where they had the wrong order , missing item or also waited more than 10 minute . I can imagine that these kind of error would happen if the restaurant wa extremely busy but by looking at the people inside and the drive thru outside ... the place wa not busy so do they give poor service every time I go there ? The last time I told the manager that I 've been waiting over 10 minute for 2 cheeseburger fry and a coke so why doe it take over 10 minute to get my order ? She threw my fry back and gave me new one and then I waited another 5 minute to get the cheeseburger . BAD PLACE . Do not go unless you have the patience to wait or want to receive or miss the wrong thing in your order . \",\n",
       " \"I dont like mcdonalds but go once in a great while I go . Horrible always get my order wrong , I 've been there four time in the 3 year I 've lived in this area and every order wrong ! Went back told supervisor no apology , serious crabby face and just gave me right order . I will never again go there . pas this one right up trust me ! \",\n",
       " \"I am very amazed at the hard working employee of this McDonald 's . They are so busy at this downtown location yet they manage to serve you your meal with a smile . They have so many different kind of people , tourist , student , worker and of course plenty of street bums/crazies . Yet they seem to function seamlessly . I come here because I am hooked on their McCafees and recently Frappuccinos and occasional small fry . It just amazes me that such a busy location can function so nicely . My order is always taken promptly . I do not stand in line more that 5 minute and I am treated with a smile and because of this I took time out of my day to write this review for them a a thank you ! \",\n",
       " \"Managers are rude to customer , I asked if the apple pie were soft or hard . The manager replied `` there apple pie Man '' what kind of answer is that ! \",\n",
       " \"I wo n't be critical because it wa only a Mcdonalds but it wa n't in a very good neighborhood , and I especially know that because I used to live there ( Bronzeville ) . The people did n't seem so smart either and they were also pretty lazy . But my real problem wa the service . It wa horrible , the person who gave u our food ate half of our fry right in front of u ! And later , me and my dad called that Mcdonalds and found out that it wa the manager who wa eating our food . I 'll never go back ! \",\n",
       " \"This is not a family-friendly location . There 's ALWAYS a crowd of undesirable hanging outside , and even inside . The police are always circling around , sometimes 2-3 police car at once . I also witnessed an older gentleman pick up who I believe to have been a prostitute . He pulled up shortly after I did . I sat in the car for a while handling business on the phone . He stayed in his car . After a while , a young man exited with a woman dressed `` differently '' and watched her walk over to his car . They drove away together . I decided it wa time to go ... \",\n",
       " \"Normally I do n't review a chain unless something about that particular location stand out , good or bad.This location for some reason , ha the most ridiculous service I 've ever encountered . It 's McDonalds you say , what do you expect ? Not much , really but let me tell you ... ENCOUNTER # 1I ordered 10-piece chicken nugget , fry , and unsweetened ice tea . I got the nugget and tea . I went up to the counter , placed my receipt on the counter gently faced away from me , and said `` I 'm sorry , I -- '' Before I finished my sentence , the employee SLAMMED her hand on my receipt on the counter and dragged it towards her . Um ... WTF ? ! I did n't know how to react because she looked at my receipt and threw it away without addressing me . I went `` um ... ok ... '' and backed away from the counter to fill my tea . I have no clue what I did to piss this employee off but my friend who came with me , asked me what the heck happened . I said `` I have no clue , I 'm just missing my fry ... '' My friend wa nice and *itchy enough to go up to the counter , grab the attention of a different employee and told him we were missing our fries.But honestly , what is wrong with you ? I 'm SORRY you were having a bad day but that doe n't excuse you from taking it out on a customer who wa trying to be nice about an honest mistake that can be easily fixed . Not a big deal , I paid for fry and I have an incomplete order . So chill , geez. -- -- -- -- -ENCOUNTER # 23 friend and I came here for smoothy . One of my friend ordered a big mac , nugget and fry . Everyone else got our order . My friend waited 20 minute for his order to be done . No lie , we looked at the time on the receipt.You 're thinking , um yea maybe they were cooking it . No ... In that 20 minute , we saw 5 employee goofing off , bickering with each other , throwing towel at each other , and basically ... being extremely unprofessional . They did n't even do this in the back were customer cant see , they did this all in front of u , just on the other side of the counter . Based on the manager 's asking where the order is , they seem to have forgotten about the order.I do n't care if you do this at work , but can you do this when no one is waiting for their food ? It 's really awkward to be standing and waiting while watching you goof off AND have your manager ask the team where our order is ... THREE times.I really felt embarrassed for the manager because this just reflects badly on him but he really should be more assertive and keep his team in check . For his credit , he did give u a coupon for a free dessert of our choice ... which honestly is nothing because I dont ever order a pie , cone , or sundae.oh and our smoothy were not filled all the way to the top ... mine wa 75 % full . \",\n",
       " 'Every time I come here they mess up my order ... .I NEVER leave the drive thru window before checking any more ... . ',\n",
       " \"Two point right out of the gate : 1 . Thuggery know no race ( lily white frat boy from the suburb can be just a vulgar and aggressive a any group with a gang mentality ) 2 . Rating a McDonald 's and McDonald 's food is n't really an essential service ; people generally know what they 're getting - menu and quality wise - going in . The purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor . People need to know ( and I think local already do ) that , depending on the time of day ( night ) , this place is marginally dangerous . Over my last three visit to Chicago , I 've noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mob who do more looting , aggressive panhandling , and fighting than choreographed performing . In fact , this particular McDonald 's had to be closed down for several hour a couple month ago while police attempted to restore order . The Water Tower Place Mall about a block away ha seen an increase in gang activity lately , including the arrest of some armed teenager . This is n't just my take ( check out some of the other review of this place and this neighborhood ) . Many are pointing out that the Mag Mile is slowly becoming the `` Mug Mile . '' And this McDonald 's seems to be ground zero for Hip Hop Nation a they pour off the Red Line after taking up two seat on the subway while grandma ha to stand . Apologists and the agenda driven will say ( and have said ) : `` These kid are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood . '' Really ? Since when doe being authentically `` black '' include screaming nonstop obscenity with little kid around ( black and white ) ? Since when did Chicago get so soft on youth crime ? Since when did it become open season on civility ? [ Since when did my review start reading like the ranting of some terrified reactionary/fascist ? ] While it 's mildly funny that Katelyn , Emily , Ashley , and their dolly buying mommy must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the American Girl Doll store , nobody ( not even the over-privileged , country club set ) should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior . And youth thug ( of any race ) should NOT be permitted to turn this area into the `` Wild mid-West . '' Just a thought , Rahm - do what you want with it . \"]"

No exaggeration ! Everytime , yes , everytime I have gone to this drive-thru , they have screwed up my order . So you 'd better check what 's in the bag before you drive off . The trick is to find that perfect timing of when to check what 's in the bag , how to roll up your window to avoid the homeless beggar and how much time to take to examine your bag 's content without annoying the people behind you who have also been waiting for 20 minute + in the same drive-thru .

I usually order a simple burger so they 're bound to have that in stock . My friend always get salad so sometimes they 're out of the kind he usually get . But again that ha happened like 1 or 2 time at most.As for the food , even late at night the food is served hot so I 'm definitely satisfied there .

For example , one day we were craving their vanilla cone but they said that their ice cream machine wa off already so they could n't make it ! Okay . What 's the point of staying open 24 hour if you ca n't even give the customer the food they want ? ! The other day , I had a pretty bad dine-in experience . The lady behind the counter charged extra for big mac sauce on the McDouble which I have NEVER experienced before . Usually going through drive-thru , they never charge extra for a McDouble w/o the ketchup , w/ big mac sauce and shredded lettuce ( a.k.a a Big Mac , but cheaper ! ) . My boyfriend and I were pretty shocked when she told u we had to pay extra for the sauce and she claimed that they always do this which they really NEVER DO ! ! Then , this same lady proceeded to close the cash register before giving me my change ! She told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she open it for the next customer . So I patiently waited ... and then she closed the cash register AGAIN after the next customer and totally forgot to give me my change ! ! ! ! So I had to remind her again to which she just laughed and semi-apologized and then finally gave me my change after like a decade of waiting ! ARGH ! Worst McDonalds worker ever ! !

They will not give you ketchup or napkin unless you ask for it so if you forgot , you 'll be eating your fry a is ! If you order a combo , they would ask you `` ... medium or large ? '' As if SMALL is not an option , very tricky ! When you order a breakfast meal , they would ask `` Do you want to have orange juice instead of coffee ? '' a if there is no difference in price and you have the option of choosing juice over coffee without extra cost . They will NEVER tell you that should you make the mistake of choosing orange juice you will pay a lot more for the stupid UPGRADE ! Is this how McDonalds became the most successful franchise ?

I think that 's mine . '' Ironically , my ORANGE JUICE is what held up the order while I watched the biscuit , McMuffin and hashy-b 's get cold . I walked out politely but my head wa spinning with entitled yuppie frustration and thought of `` Well , I 'm never going in there again . '' One time , no joke , I got a cheeseburger with no burger ! Kinda hilarious actually , and the manager came through for me with a TWO free cheeseburger a an apology . Despite all that , YOU KNOW I 'LL STILL BE BACK . Maybe not IN the location , but in the drive through for sure . Do n't get me started on the 2-lane merging drive through .

Yelp , I hope you 're paying attention , because if this veritable display of fast food prowess is n't enough to grant me Elite status , I just do n't know what is.Because it 's McDonald 's , and everyone know that McDonald 's serf the most amazing flash-frozen food in the world , I employ a different rating system where every one I go to start at 5 star . I take off star according to my experience there.Let 's begin for this location:5 star : it 's McDonald 's , for chrissake . I do n't need to justify this.4 star : I had to knock it down one star because they ran out of cheeseburger once at like 2:00am . When they first told me , it did n't even register in my brain . I ordered two cheeseburger and the lady replied `` sorry , we do n't have cheeseburger right now . '' All I could say wa `` no , just a regular one , not a McDouble . '' She had to repeat it again and I wa so flabbergasted that I sat silently in the drive-thru window a my world wa crashing around me . Four hour later I wa able to collect my thought and order a Filet-O-Fish.3 star : there is a constant ring of transient that surround this place late at night . They come up to you when you 're pulling up to the window . They do n't even ask for food , they try and give you money to buy stuff for them because , presumably you ca n't ride a shopping cart into the drive-thru . One time I wa feeling nice and bought a lady a coffee , but then she proceeded to yell at me a I wa driving away because I only got her 10 sugar packet instead of the 50 million that she requested . On the plus side , the establishment doe a reasonably good job of keeping them out after hour , so now I know where to board myself up during a Zombie Apocalypse.2 star : one time they questioned me when I ordered 80 nugget . DID I STUTTER ? It 's 3:00am on a Saturday night , you should be questioning the people who get a 6 piece . 100 is pretty standard these day . With two of every sauce , including some that do n't exist ( `` zesty ... chipotle ... thai peanut butter ?

At night , the area is pretty desolate until the early morning hour of around 3 or 4 in the morning when the area come alive . Now I will admit that the proximity to the Greyhound station is n't attracting the typical McDonalds crowd , and I expect they sell more Dollar Menu item than they do Happy Meals . And it would n't be my first choice ordinarily , but the other McDonalds at Olympic and Central wa closed due to remodeling on a night I wa really craving some fry on the way home . So I put on my bold face ( the one that say `` do n't ask me S**T ! '' ) and figured I 'd tough it out at Alameda and 7th . It wa around 9:00pm on a weeknight.When I pulled in , I noticed how brightly lit it wa . And while there seemed to be a few car in the drive thru , none of them looked like they were waiting for very long . Seeing the same type of buzz inside , I decided to go inside and walk up to the counter.When I got inside , I can only guess someone there read Yelp review . It wa ridiculously clean , they seemed to have adequate staff on hand , and they moved very efficiently . The counter staff wa very friendly , the food came fast and wa hot.Now naturally this should n't be a guarantee for all future visit ... but it wa a good experience and show what can be done .

No . The staff here have to be contractor . Hired gun . Soldiers of Fortune . Blackwater mercenary . Warriors jaded after year of serving tour in suburbia and south central .

       " \"I am writing a review for McDonald 's due to my experience there tonight . I usually try my best to avoid this location because of the loiterer . They are not like the usual homeless people at other place and I get skeeved by them . I ca n't really describe..maybe escapee from the loony house or zombie ? Anyway ... Of course while waiting in line at the drive-thru I see yet another of these loiterer . I started cringing and wished I never came here . But when we pulled up to the pick-up window , I noticed that there wa a security guard ! He stand right by the door and when this loiterer wa sneaking back up to the McD premise , he basically busted out his handcuff . The loiterer ran off.It 's a sad situation , but a relief at a same time to witness tonight 's McD action . \",\n",
       " \"Bigger the industry lower the quality of a product . Particularly food industry . McDonald 's is a champ on this matter . I go to this place for a drink from time to time , my boyfriend is hooked on their juice . It is nice , but that 's about it . They are spending too much on their franchise , marketing and packaging . Food should look more natural than trying to make it look like on a picture..plastic , silicone and who know what . Ice cream are also OK . But I would n't go further than that.Also , I feel sorry for employee . \",\n",
       " \"The only thing I 'm going to write about it is the location itself and the service . This location is great if you work nearby ( so you dont have to park behind the building ) , and there is a lot of seating . However , it is always crowded , and some of the people who are there seem a little suspect . The worker quite efficient ; I imagine that with the sort of crowd they get , they are pretty fast at getting your food out pretty quickly . Just order , and they 'll take your name down and then you 'll get your food within 5 minute . Due to the myriad type of character that are inside , I tend to just pick up my food and head back to eat in my office . \",\n",
       " 'I go here frequently during lunch . But why is it that they never have any apple pie ready ? ? They always ask that you wait 5-10 minute for them . ',\n",
       " \"The only thing that saved this fast food restaurant from receiving two star from me is their table availability and size.Environment : This McDonald 's ha a big table for a group of 12 people ; if I remember it correctly . The BIG letdown is the store policy of no refill on drink allowed and loitering is not allowed - only maximum of 30 minutes.Food : The quality in term of newly cooked is dependent on the time of visit . I visit in the morning so their regular all-day menu is not sitting in the heating trays/cabinets.Crew/Servers : Same a other McDonald 's . \",\n",

       " \"It 's 10:14 pm and let me just say , from shopping all day and getting attitude all day from rude over worked associate it wa nice to hear and see these McDonald 's associate in such a good mood . The girl that took our order in the drive thru wa very nice and polite , great energy and very upbeat personality absolutely loved her I did n't get her name but she definitely made my drive through visit very pleasant . The other girl that gave u our order her name wa Jessica , she wa also very nice . It 's ppl like these young lady that make service worth the wait . Great job girl ! \",\n",

       " \"OMG . Busiest McDonald 's ever . I do n't think anything special wa going on , so uggghhhh.I had just finished moving all of my stuff from a U-haul down the street and wa so tired and hot and all I wanted wa a McFlurry and a burger . I think that wa too much to handle . The McFlurry came out quickly . The burger ? Not so much.Their weird coffee machine wa busted ( I do n't understand why people want to eat those sugar drink ) , and it wa making this huge line . They also had about 40 people behind the counter and 20 of them trying to fix the machine . I lie , but you get the idea . So , I waited and waited and waited and waited for the burger , like 15 minute . I hate to say stuff , and I could tell they were backed up so I kept thinking it wa just getting there ( other people were waiting a while , too ) . I finally did say something , and OH WADDYA KNOW . My burger wa just sitting there at the end of the line.These two middle school boy had been waiting on something since before I had got there . I told them just to push up to the front and show them their receipt . They did , and walked out minute later.OH . And the place is on a east-west axis with no shade . It wa HOT in there . \",\n",
       " \"They always get my order wrong when I come : ( I order a snack wrap with NO CHEESE , add pickle . I got it WITH CHEESE and no freaking lettuce on my snack wrap ? ! Ugh . But I never go and complain . : / whatever 's . I blame kitchen people . Get it together . \",\n",
       " \"Like the other reviewer Zee R. I live near by and wa going frequently since March 2014 for morning breakfast and I 've had this same problem ! Missing hash brown , missing chocolate chip cooky , missing one of my rounded egg in deluxe breakfast ! It 's a hassle to drive back up to get my complete meal by the time I get home everything is cold ! Sheesh ! \",\n",
       " \"This location is hit or miss , it usually ok . But 2 occasion made me not want to come back . The first wa when the McWrap came out , I ordered a grilled chicken and bacon mcwrap with no garlic sauce . When I got it , it had sauce . No big deal , I walked back up , explained what happened , and asked if I could have another without sauce . I didnt ask to replace mine , a I decided to give that one to a friend , and I just ordered a new one . A couple minute later , I got it without sauce , but they also left out the bacon ! So I had to go back to the counter , they gave me some bacon to put in but how hard is it to make these thing ? My second experience that i 'd rather forget wa when I ordered a grilled chicken chipotle snack wrap . Snack wrap are small a it is , but this one seemed to be folded in half of what is the normal size . I went and asked why it wa so small and the guy got a manager who told me the chicken is weighed and it wa fine . I have never had a snack wrap like that before or since . I wouldnt care if they had replaced it or gave me more chicken , but the fact that they stood behind it is why i 'll never go back there unless I absolutely have to . I pretty much ate it with one bite , \",\n",

I waited a lot longer than I needed to just to order . If they did n't have bum loitering around , maybe would have added one more star . The staff is not the problem , they look like they actually have to deal with a lot if problematic people . They should focus on making the place a little pleasant for their guest . No one want to eat their burger while having to endure the smell if urine lingering off a homeless person . \"]"

Because the cashier wa VERY distracted from conversing with friend and coworkers . I would give zero star , but 1 star is for the manager , who seemed to be the only one who wa trying to fulfill the customer orders.I have n't been to a McDonalds in year , and this experience will serve a a reminder to me of why I should continue not to do so . \",\n",

Long wait on non-peak hour were common . Rather frustrating waiting 10 minute for a chicken warp . I could swear that some day there only one person working the cashier and another in the kitchen .

I went back to get the teabag and then sat back down at a gross table that had soda spilled on it . Thing is , the soda had *dried* and made the table top quite sticky . As I waited for my tea to cool , a guy decided to throw himself into his seat , rocking the table and sending half the tea into my lap . Oh joy.Now I know McD 's is n't responsible for this guy being an idiot , but the table wa pretty big and for it to be that unstable that a guy jumping into a booth would rock it so badly is just sad.I left utterly disgusted with this place . It 's a shame because the interior wa decorated very nicely , including a nice wood frame that resembles a house inside , but now ha scratch all over it ( most looking like deliberate graffiti ) .

I picked up a fish sandwich for my mother , what I got wa a sandwich that wa n't even close to being warm . I once bought a ice cream for my nephew , seeing how he will probably make a mess I asked for a napkin only to be rejected . I ca n't even have a napkin for my little nephew 's ice cream ? I do n't want to further elaborate on how bad the service is , the staff here give all the customer an attitude . And the decor on the outside , a temple ? Really ? Because it Chinatown ? ? Do they design McDonalds to look like mosque ? Churches ? Or whatever ethnic structure ? This place is a lousy and disgusting eyesore , nuff said . If you want some McDs in the local area , go to the one on Canal st. Its a longer walk , but at least they do n't treat like crap .

My favorite thing about this McD 's is the 2 for $ 1 's . I love the apple pie and the ice cream sundae because I can treat a cousin to dessert for $ .50 ! The best part about this McD 's is that they have hashbrowns , 2 for $ 1 ! They do n't have this everywhere .

       " \"Located on the border of the West and Greenwich village , this McDonald 's restaurant ( which according to wikipedia is a part of the world 's largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurant ) is in a prime location.While the decor is a little dated , it reflects the some of the architecture and older building in the village . There is also a great hanging mural of basketball player located above the register and can be better viewed while dining on the second floor of the establishment ( the art most likely drew inspiration from the West 4th street court located across from the restaurant , paying homage to the local ) .Instead of order from a waiter you order individually through the designated cash register , while this may seem like more work it doe save you some extra cash and also let you customize your order directly without having to go through another person . The menu itself ha it 's staple , 'The Big Mac ' , 'Filet-O-Fish ' , 'McNuggets ' and of course the french fry which are all bargain for the amount of food you receive when compared to other restaurant . There is also an ever changing rotation of new sandwich , wrap , salad and other specialty item ; all of which have the same McDonald 's quality.This past visit I ordered a McDouble , a large french fire and a 4 piece McNuggets . The food wa ready for me in under five minute , a time almost unheard of at other restaurant . I took a seat at the upstairs section and started with the McDouble . The McDouble included two cooked beef patty , cheese , pickle , ketchup and chopped onion , very satisfying for under 2 dollar . I then switched between the hot crispy french fry and the McNuggets ( small deep fried piece of chicken ) which I dipped in ketchup and their very tasty honey mustard sauce . All in all I wa very full and content with my meal , all of which cost me under $ 10 , at any other local restaurant just a burger and fry would have run me more than $ 10 and most likely closer to $ 15.Although the food may not be on par , quality wise with other nearby eatery ( Minetta Tavern , 100 Acres and Market Table ) , essentially you are getting a full meal at nearly half the price and a quarter of the time . I would highly recommend this McDonald 's and look forward to visiting their other location . \",\n",

It should n't take 5 minute to complete a transaction at the register for a McDonald 's breakfast.What 's more , all I wanted wa an iced coffee . They did n't have any , which would have been nice to know , but failed to inform me that so they just gave me a hot coffee - skim , no sugar ... 10 minute after I ordered because they also ran out of hot coffee . It basically took almost 20 minute for me to get a coffee at McDonald 's at 9am on a weekday . If your restaurant and your incompetent staff ca n't handle serving coffee , then just give up . \",\n",

The customer ahead of me had been waiting on their fry for a long time and were getting impatient and angry . One of them got so angry with the useless staff on hand ( who were not taking any responsibility and were instead chuckling at the customer 's valid and reasonable complaint ) -that he flipped over the cash register . lol . I liked the fact that the customer never cussed once at them though . He wa just yelling reasonable thing at them like , `` Why do n't you do your job ? And if you hate your job so much , go to college so you can get a better job . '' That 's excellent advice.If you want to witness the most depressed people on a job -go to this Mickey D 's .

We got some hot chocolate ( which I thought would be safe ) and sat with our cookies.There is a 20 minute seating limit ( which we exceeded by several hour a we were catching up ) , and a the night wore on people were mostly coming in wasted and trying to convince the security guard to let them into the bathroom ( which is closed from 12 am -7 am ... truly , a the sign say , NO EXCEPTIONS . ) The restaurant wa dirty , there were a few moment where I felt a little unsafe a drunk kid fought with their friend in line , and to top it off it took like 10 minute to get our hot chocolate , ( there wa an issue with their machine ) , and while drinking mine , I came across a gob of congealed milk , the texture of which can only be compared to phlegm .

East Midtown is like ground zero for bomb-ass gyro guy , including the excellent one on the southeast corner of 54th and 3rd , and the inimitable Rafiqi on 50th ( or so ) and 3rd . Any of these cart will be cheaper than McDonalds , since you 're definitely going to pay Manhattan price at this location . The dollar menu is certainly anemic . There is also an assortment of good sandwich and pizza place around here.So why am I reviewing this McDonalds , you might ask . It is simple . 3rd avenue face a lack of good place to sit and eat , especially on a hot day and if you are wearing clothes that you do n't want to risk getting gyro sauce on . If you need somewhere to sit and eat , regardless of where you purchased your food , this McDonald 's is the place to go . They have excellent air conditioning , a supply of good napkin , clean table , and a nice view of the street . I can attest to the fact that the staff WILL NOT roust you from your seat , even if you are blatantly not eating McDonalds . I have eaten gyros/sandwiches/pizza in this location several time and it ha been an excellent place to eat on each occasion . \",\n",

Therefore it should not take close to 20 minute to get a simple burger and fry . They always hand back everyones food before mine . I dont know maybe they do this to pretty girl because it always happens to me here . The staff here are rude and talk way to much . Stop chatting and make my food . That is all . ',\n",

I had the pleasure of running into him twice during my entire stay ( what can i say ? i like Mcdonald's. ) . Our second encounter wa the weirdest . He started like mouthing something weird to me .

I 've been waiting for my opportunity.Today , that need wa satisfied.It 's worth a shot . No surprise . No real fat . ( i 'm sure they pulverize that a million time over , and blend it in ) . No bone . Seriously , it wa decent . The BBQ sauce is a little better than mass Heinz 57 style , and not bad , with a mixture of onion smattered on there . At $ 3.25 , including tax , this wa a much better deal than my breakfast today at quadruple the price Now onto the staff . I 've grown to understand the flow of this place.Sometimes they get their signal crossed , but in general , if watch the counter , it doe n't matter where you stand , just zoom up into that line where the person is waving . Drop your order , and step to the side . There is nothing else you can do to speed thing up . This mostly female staff from probably the same country of origin , and maybe same neighborhood work well together in their own way . 8 time out of 10 , you will be out of there in under 5 min . 10 min top !

As someone on Foursquare commented , be prepared to wait on line for a LONG time . I waited for 10 minute and the line never moved . I 've never had such slow service at any McDonalds , and I 've never had such slow service in Manhattan . I never thought I 'd face this AT a McDonalds IN Manhattan . When a new line opened up , the server deliberately ignored me and called out in Spanish to a man who had been waiting in another line le than one minute , avoiding eye contact with me the whole time . I got on line behind him . She chit-chatted with him and then went and got his food herself instead of letting the staff in the back do it . Another 5 minute . By the time I got to the front of the line , no `` welcome '' , not even a smile for me . I ordered my breakfast . She took my money and then proceeded to take the next two order -- this time , of course , having the staff ( which themselves were working at a snail 's pace ) get my food . She handed me the bag with no receipt and no `` thank you '' . I thought to complain to the manager , and then I looked at the nameplate of the person serving me . She WAS the manager . I hardly ever have had a bad experience at McDonalds , but I guess there 's a first for everything . From now on , I 'm getting my Big Mac fix at Penn Station or any of the other location OTHER than this disaster at 28th and 6th . Just not this one , at least until I take some Spanish lesson , which seems to be the prerequisite to be treated like a human being . \",\n",

There are good McDonald 's and bad McDonald 's and this one wa just in the middle . The burger wa warm , not hot , but tasted fine .

Some few minute later , we hear a commotion towards the entrance . I turn around and see what appears to be the dirtiest looking homeless man with long grey hair and beard and dirt stained jacket with hole in his shoe . The manager happened to notice him immediately and tried to escort him out . One thing led to another and this guy started going off on one of the most hate-fueled rant I 've ever heard .

Objectively speaking , I imagined this 6'4ish looking man wa at one point quite educated and maybe even handsome . I wa too busy observing the scene to actually record anything for Youtube . At first , he directed his hatred towards the manager and then went into a long address to everyone in the store . Long story short : there is a revolution coming and we are ill-prepared . We are leading our life in ignorance and before we know it , the tide will shift . Men `` like him '' are congregating and amassing technology and weapon beyond our knowledge . Lol ok. At this point , he gestured pulling out a weapon and shooting everyone . At this point , the manager forcibly escorted him out against his restraint . A few moment later , he ran back in and pulled out an imaginary grenade , tossed it in the store , and ran back outside . I wa just trying to enjoy my chicken nugget .

The french fry are an example of potato that have been prepared in a form that may be legitimately considered a work of art . The gentle texture and crisp of the fry are testament to the corporation 's impeccable execution of deep frying , and the training that the personnel have undergone to achieve this perfection across the franchise is very much laudable . My experience with the beef ha been nothing short of flawless . As I had requested , the patty in my burger wa prepared to a medium-rare , and the subtle cheese and softly-grated onion danced with the rich ketchup and mustard on my tongue , a I tasted thick and quality processed meat between two piece of toasted and warm bun . The acidity of the salted fry and that of the burger did not balance quite a I liked it , though I wa very much satisfied anyway . I have to say that short of make-up sex , I have had no better experience in my 20 's . To finish my three-course , the apple pie were magnificent . The texture of the apple led me to believe that they were , in fact , potato , but I must commend McDonald 's for aptly managing their resource and overhead by taking advantage of economy of scale in purchasing only mass quantity of one ingredient , a opposed to diversifying their portfolio ; this may lead to higher margin in that the franchise would be able to provide more product in their menu e.g . genuine apple smoothy or apple-infused panacotta , but would ultimately lead to higher operating cost . In any case , the dessert wa very much satisfying.Though I paid only $ 6.00 for this meal , I must have gained the delight of a $ 60.00 meal .

       " \"Quick , somebody call the fire department . There 's a carbon monoxide leak at the McDonald 's on 6th and 1st Ave . The staff are showing the telltale sluggish , sleepy sign of poisoning.This place make me sad . Every time I go , I see a herd of people standing at the counter . It begin the inevitable questioning : '' Did ... I 'm sorry , have you ordered ? `` `` No , not yet . `` `` Oh , ok , um , ma'am have YOU ordered ? `` `` Oh no , I 'm just here to read the pretty sign . `` Etc. , and so on , etc ... .When you do order , the real chaos in the kitchen begin . I 've seen Gordon Ramsay on calmer day then some of these people . `` ANGEL , FOR GOD 'S SAKE , I NEED FOUR CHEESEBURGERS FIVE MINUTES AGO , WHAT IS TAKING YOU SO LONG ? ! ? ! `` MARK , I 'M DOING THE BEST I CAN AND I 'M HAVING A REALLY BAD DAY , SO STEP OFF , OK ! ? ! OK ? ! ? ! `` This played out between numerous employee while waiting for my food . I did n't even try to hide the laughter.These day , the only McDonald 's I tend to visit fall under three categories:1 ) I am within 1/2 of a freeway and there are no other options2 ) I am in high school , it 2 AM , it 's suburbia , I 'm hungry , and there are no other sign of life3 ) I 'm jonesing for Hi-C Orange Drink ( the colloquial , vivid description of the beverage is what really draw me in ) I took the commercial ' advice and took advantage of my right a a New Yorker to order the Big Angus burger . I had one earlier in the month and I remembered it being much better than your general ten-packets-of-sugar-per-bun-grade-c-beef Micky D 's fare.Oh wow . This wa bad . And I mean BAD . It 's awfulness may or may not have been highlighted by the fact that I wa reading an article a I ate about the fatal case of `` superbug '' staph infection being on the rise in New York . The mayo had the appearance of cream cheese . The onion looked , felt , and tasted a though they had spent the better part of a week floating in water . The burger meat itself wa bland , flavorless , and had the consistency of - oh , what the hell am I doing . Am I really here , wasting a beautiful Sunday afternoon sitting in my living room to write about the inferior quality of a meal at McDonald 's ? Am I that sad ? This McD 's in particular is used a a haunt for the local , random old people clique that you will find in every neighborhood on earth . An old woman took a table of four to herself next to me ( even though seating wa scarce a it wa ) and began conversation with , like , 4 people who walked in.OH , and do you know what I noticed today ? The aftertaste of Dr. Pepper taste EXACTLY like Play-Doh ! It 's so weird ! Half the people who read that just went `` WTF , YOU ATE PLAY-DOH AS A CHILD ? ? ? '' and the other half went `` Oh my God , I know exactly what he 's talking about ! '' I mean , come on , it say non-toxic right on the can , and the pizza I used to make with blue and purple topping were simply too tempting ... I dare someone to click `` Formal ( Jacket Required ) '' for dress for this place.OK , I 'm done with this review . \",\n",

I suppose if they actually get your order right that 's commendable . But everything 's awful . And cold . And sloppily done . And the place is just skeevy . The food is all off . I mean , it 's not that hard ... it 's MCDONALDS ! ! And I 've been to quite a few M-C-D 's in my day , but this one just take the cake ... and ruin the orange soda . Wow .

I noticed last week that they had opened in the same place where the KFC stood for decades.I know they added more item to their dollar menu & more selection . so I thought i would try some . I ordered a BBQ Ranch burger and a Buffalo ranch McChicken . The order wa completed in le than 5 minute and the service wa professional.The BBQ ranch burger is topped with slice of white cheddar , barbecue sauce that is decent and crispy corn chip . The Buffalo ranch McChicken is a crispy McChicken patty topped with Buffalo sauce , creamy buttermilk ranch dressing and shredded iceberg lettuce , served on a toasty bun . ',\n",

Well it even better when you have to stay longer because the flight are delayed here 6 more time in addition to the first 2 delay . I can only eat the fish sandwich and fry , because I do n't eat red meat or chicken . The food wa hot and the fry were good with just the right amount of salt sprinkled on them.McDonald 's of Jersey Airport . Thanks for being open 24/7 \",\n",
       " \"I 've come not to expect a lot out of airport McDonalds but this one by far is the worst . The only reason they have one star is because they are open before everyone one else . Fries were cold and mushy , coke wa watered down a it had been pre-filled for the rush and the ice wa all melted . I could kick myself for not just making the haul over to the 100 gate and going to Smashburger but I wa feeling lazy . And when is lazy rewarded ? Never .

At least Mickey D 's doe n't rape it customer by charging outrageous price for something you can buy at any supermarket for under $ 2 ... well , maybe it rape our artery a bit , but if you practice moderation , you should be just fine . \",\n",

All of this at airport price . There are other choice so please avail yourself of them . ',\n",

They take your order and move you to the right hand side to pick up your order . It wa hard to pick up my order because it wa that much people standing at the counter . Plus this Mcdonald is small , there wa no real spot to line up to place your order . ( ** ) The serve here wa bad , the cashier had attitude problem , but I do n't blame them because working at Mcdonalds is n't the greatest job in the world .

We had to drive around her since she wa blocking the entrance and her male passenger got out of the car and started making lude gesture and disrespectful comment about my late mother ... McDonald 's headquarters were contacted the next day and said they were sorry with what happened ... Management from this store emailed me back first asking if it wa one of there employee that wa backing up ... Do n't they read the complaint correctly ? ? ?

So this review is for you `` healthy person growing up '' , or the person who just crawled out of a rock..I will keep this short and sweet . Chicken nugget is whats good here . All White , Crispy Chicken Nuggets . As dipping sauce , you got ta get either Sweet and Sour , BBQ sauce , or Honey Mustard ... .I think I just told you all their sauce ... ; ) Anyways , burger wise I used to get Big Mac , thats two burger patty in a special yummy sauce ... now they have some Angus Burger with Bacon . I had it last year , it pretty good . Well , thats it . Enjoy your Fast Food here ...

SO I thought I would try that , a McDouble and a medium French fry . When I ordered I started with the mozzarella stick . The cashier thought I said chicken McNuggets . I corrected her and said the mozzarella stick . Then I also ordered the McDouble and the medium French fry . My order wa rung up and I got my order withing 5 minute . That 's good . Bad- I ca n't for the life of me find where the salt , pepper and ketchup is on the first floor . If they have it on the second floor I do n't remember . I wa in a rush to get home so I grabbed my food and went to wait for the subway . I looked in the bag and wa surprised at what I saw . In my bag wa a medium order of French fry , 4 chicken McNuggets , a McDouble , and a pack of marinara sauce . I used the marinara sauce for the chicken . However , in what language doe mozzarella stick sound like chicken McNuggets ? And I wonder what the price difference wa between the mozzarella stick and 4 piece chicken McNuggets.I already swiped my Metrocard so it wa n't worth it to complain . \",\n",

       " 'Terrible customer service . I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minute . There wa no one else waiting for their food inside either , just outside at the window . I left and went to Chickfila next door and wa greeted before I wa all the way inside . This McDonalds is also dirty , the floor wa covered with dropped food . Obviously filled with surly and unhappy worker . ',\n",
       " \"First they `` lost '' my order , actually they gave it to someone one else than took 20 minute to figure out why I wa still waiting for my order.They after I wa asked what I needed I replied , `` my order '' .They asked for my ticket and the asst mgr looked at the ticket then incompletely filled it.I had to ask her to check to see if she filled it correctly.She acted a if she could n't be bothered with that so I asked her again.She begrudgingly checked to she did in fact miss something on the ticket.So after 22 minute I finally had my breakfast biscuit platter.As I left an woman approached and identified herself a the manager , she wa dressed a if she had just awoken in an old t-shirt and sweat pants.She said she had heard what happened and said she 'd take care of it.Well why did n't she intervene when she saw I wa growing annoyed with the incompetence ? \",\n",

       " \"Well , it 's McDonald 's , so you know what the food is . This review reflects solely on the poor service . I have been to this location countless time over the year . They consistently fail on the service end of thing . The order taker tend to be rude , no smile , and a lot of `` sigh '' and `` lip smacking '' when you talk to them . So why go back you ask ? This store benefit from being the only place to eat in this area . The next stop is at least 12 minute away on the other side of town . Also I strongly believe in 2nd chance and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100 % of the time . I have given them many chance at earning a positive review . I could not recommend this location any le . If you can wait , take a pas . There are better McDonald 's store in Griffin , GA . \",\n",

Also , this morning , I guess the worker thought his mic wa off , but it wa n't . I now know that he is trying to get a many hour a possible because he need money BAD . Spread the word . Anyway , this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end . It would have helped if there wa one .

Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it get better ... .We get to next window where Einstein is waiting , pours the coffee with different creams/sugars added . `` Which one is which ? '' I asked ... and he smiled and said `` One ha 2 cream 2 sugar and the other ha 3 cream 1 sugar '' .. didnt maek the cup ... but at least he made sure we had straw for our coffee ... .

We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of car waiting to order . We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour . So we wait about 5 - 10 minute for our turn to order . We order the special they were having at that time ( 20 pc chicken nugget for $ 5 ) and asked for a cup of water because we did n't want to drink any soda at that late hour . They take our order but tell u they do n't serve cup of water there . So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order . However , we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food . By far the worst McDonalds in the world . Unfriendly and slow . \",\n",

I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it need to be worth it . Also the fry used to be cold and the cheese on the burger wa never melted . Everything wa just lukewarm . Now my order ha been right a few time in a row and my food hot . Also , I love dining room . Usually you would n't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place ha nice flooring , stacked stone , lot of large window and a flat screen TV usually on HLN .

I inquired about that before and wa told , that when someone drive off that mess up the order.Well , I guess there 's no controlling drive off , and at least I know my order ha been confirmed , so it should be right by the time I get to the second window.This McDonald 's , also ha a late night drive thru Thur - Sat , it use to be a 24 hour on those day , but I do n't think it is any longer . One of my biggest pet peeve is that the drive thru staff ha no smile in their voice .

Hands down this is the slowest McDonald 's drive thru I 've experienced in Atlanta . Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service . As a lover of Sweet Tea , I wa completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it wa a few year ago . She told a few of her associate that it wa like `` syrup '' and `` liquid diabetes '' . By the time I took my first and only sip , I wa on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup ! Thank goodness for the McDonald 's near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink . So the moral to the story is , if you 're on Camp Creek Pkwy near the airport , bypass McDonald 's and head for Chick-fil-A . # EatMoreChicken \",\n",

Now how is that when they are waiting on their order ... hell I wa thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting. ! Anyway finally placed order and wa told $ 1.07 , which I paid exact price . Here is where it sad ... the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt . I know that she planned to pocket the money , which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customer through price increase . I will not return here because I do n't like to feel like I am in someone 's `` hood '' and I HATE A THIEF ! ! ! maybe I will call to tell them but then again they probably do n't care or maybe even steal themselves . plus I do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minute \",\n",

I told him and he said looked into the bag , grabbed the xtra fry and lterally threw them into the waste bucket by the drive tru from the cashier . Then reached into cash register and gave me change for the fry . Then i said thank you and he said ok bos and I left . I then called mcdonalds people via the nimber on the website after I ate . I told then I wa going to wait to yelp after I heard from McDonalds . Still no call or email . As a side note ... Tom N.

       " \"TOXIC DUMP ! In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically , I do NOT eat McDonalds food ; yet similar to the experience of others `` trapped '' at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hour of operation . Due to a relative stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself `` trapped '' and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds . Mostly my visit were for coffee or ice cream sundae . However , last night , for the first time I ordered food ( grilled chicken salad ) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY . This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me wa the customer service offered by employee ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL ; then consider what that mean for each and every person that approach your counter to order . HOW you do not SEE them , in FACT that you easily DISMISS them , is beyond my comprehension to understand ! HOW you lost your sense of humanity , in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity ? Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 week : each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model ( in food ) which now ha transferred ( we learned ) into their employee . NOT once wa I thanked for giving my order ; NOT ONCE wa I thanked when delivered my order . Yet , at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behavior that were readily displayed and relayed in body language , effort toward actual work , and obvious attitude not only toward me , but guest in front of me . God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu ( employee response : blank stare , shrug , looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again ) . God forbid , on separate occasion I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw . Last night , I happened to ask for my drink please ( after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal ) YIKES , you think I had asked him to draw blood ! ***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am , 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY ! Not just dirty , but FILTHY ! Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area ; also in the dining room ? Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cooky ALREADY ? It 's been 11 week and that crud is STILL smeared dried ; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertop , payment pad , straw holder , everywhere spill occur ; including area customer touch . EVERY HOUR ! Get it ? Every single hour ! GET a cleaning ONLY employee ! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED ! Just stop this ATROCIOUSLY DIRTY & DISGUSTING feeding trough you call a restaurant . You should be ashamed . **************************************************Î_**************************************Northside Hospital ~ YOU are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your wall !

HOW this doe NOT cause you to react and ACT is beyond me.In my world , with SO MANY option available , this place would be GONE ~ like TODAY ; certainly NOT any longer than tomorrow !

Case in point : There wa about a two week stretch where I would go to McDonald 's every morning before work to get an iced vanilla latte . EVERY day ( I kid you not ) they got my order wrong and made me a hot latte instead . This would not be a problem , but they questioned me every time if I wa sure that wa what I ordered . Yes , it even showed it on your fancy digital menu . Then they would ask me to pull up and wait 10 minute for my order to be corrected . My bf and I went inside once to order and they got his order wrong . The woman just stood there and looked at u when we told her and my bf wa like , `` ... but I guess I can eat this '' . Later when we went up and asked for sauce , she gave u the biggest eyeroll upon seeing u and acted like it wa physically painful for her to serve u . These are only a couple of example of the horrible service we have had , but I guess that 's typical for a McDonald 's attached to a gas station . \",\n",

       " \"Awful ! I once waited 30 minute for a small Iced vanilla coffee . It wa unbelievable , myself and several other customer were shocked at how slow they were to make simple food , there 's nothing fancy about McDonald 's so why it took so long is beyond me . They are always slow at this location , it doe n't matter if you do drive thru walk in . On another occasion I did the drive thru and got a burger and 2 apple pie . I ate one pie that had something hard and plastic like in it . I 'm definitely sure it wa n't apple or pie crust , so disgusting . I wo n't ever come here again , McDonald 's just keep getting worse . \",\n",

I do n't eat beef and did n't order that , however I had already paid for my meal with my card . The QT wa more than my fish meal so I wa told they would refund me the QT and they charged me for the fish meal . Have been checking bank account all weekend no refund . Went back to the store and spoke to manager Starla who told me refund can take up to two day to go through . It 's Tuesday Oct 7th ! My payment went through yesterday for two meal purchased Oct 3rd , one of which I did n't eat or take with me . Not happy . Starla tried to make the excuse that yesterday Oct 6th wa a holiday . I said `` what holiday '' she say Columbus day . I never had respect for that man but do recognize his holiday is on the 13th for my bank so I informed Starla that yesterday wa not a bank holiday . She would n't call the GM this evening stating the GM ( General Manager ) would be there tomorrow between 9to5 . I 'm working then too so it 's a big inconvenience taking time from my job to get them to do their job . I 'm really not happy with this McDonalds . Need to train their staff to be careful with people money . I want my money back and if I do n't get it I will go to every place that I use to rate business and really make known my disapproval of how they do business . \",\n",

       " \"This McDonald 's is located right next to the building which house Studio Movie Grill . It 's super convenient to stop by and grab a quick bite before watching a movie if you do n't want to spend a lot of money for food at the theater . But that 's pretty much where the pro of this location stop.I 've been to this McDonald 's several time , but I 've been a bit disappointed on several occasion . Most recently , I went through the drive-thru and got a simple order - a McChicken sandwich and small fry . I drove to the Studio Movie Grill parking lot to eat before a movie and noticed that my fry were cold . UGHHHHH ... Cold McDonald 's fry are the worst . Lame ! ! ! The employee seem to be pretty friendly , and the restaurant look decent inside . Unfortunately , they lack power outlet ( I saw one , but maybe there 's a one or two more scattered throughout the restaurant ) . This make it inconvenient for people who like to stop by McDonald 's to use their laptop , which I do quite often.Overall , this McDonald 's deserves about 2.5 star because it 's right in between `` meh '' and `` A-OK. '' I know some may say it 's `` just a McDonald 's , '' but hey - I 've been to numerous other location where their food is pretty consistent ( do n't serve COLD fry ! ) and there are numerous power outlet for customer ' use . I 'll probably be back just because it 's right next to Studio Movie Grill , but I 'm hoping they 'll start improving the quality of their fast food - at least to the McDonald 's standard .

       " \"this is CLEARLY a franchise location , and they.do.not.care . This place is a cash cow .

       " \"My poor wife , stepdaughter and her THREE Johns Creek junior lacrosse Gladiator teammate who spent the night Saturday and were CRAVING Mickey D 's this morning . Second week in a row ma 's been screwed by this franchise store 10131 . It 's just so close to u and the kid really wanted it . Yeah , yeah - `` fool me once . '' And I even said `` now honey , be SURE to check the bag for everything before you drive away since these same folk screwed u on Easter morning en route to church . `` But that 's tough to do - nearly impossible - with a car full of tweens and on busy Holcomb Bridge Road en route to Barnwell with three big bag stuffed with $ 45 worth of McD 's decadence . Imagine three bag stuffed full of food - all in individual wrapper and some almost too hot to handle . But why should we even have to check behind these folk fully expecting our order have been satisfied . You get what you pay for , right ? NOT at this franchise store . At least on this blustery but sunny Sunday morning ma got a receipt . Three sandwich missing this time totaling $ 6 ; last week 's tally wa about the same . What 's worse is you have no recourse because the franchise 's contact number on the receipt go straight to fax . No really . See for yourselves : 770-998-7710 . Diabolical strategy to be sure . We 're not even fast food fan by any stretch . Especially after watching Morgan Spurlock 's 'Super Size Me ' a few year back . BLECH ! en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su\\x8a\\x97_And truth be told , if the adjacent Chick-fil-a wa open on Sunday that would be our first choice . But it 's not . And now we 're left with no choice for Sunday morning brekky on the go because we 're NEVER , EV-URH going back to this McDonald 's . Hey , but do n't you know people talk . Especially here in Johns Creek . All of our adjacent neighborhood and sport team have monthly news letter and social medium site .

       " \"I admit , I 'm not a big fan of McDonald 's . However , sometimes , nothing hit the spot like their fry and a Diet Coke . What push this location over the edge of some others is the staff . They 're always super nice whether it 's 10am or 10pm . They do n't make you repeat your order 18 time and they get it right . They 're also generous with the condiment when you ask for them ( and even when you do n't ! ) . Unlike some fast food place that stop serving milkshake after a certain hour because they 've already cleaned the machine , they 'll make you a milkshake up until they close . Service is a huge thing for me so the fact that they 're always smiling and ready to help me get my fat fix is what make me partial to this particular location . It can be a bit of a pain to get into and out of a it 's right on Holcomb Bridge Rd , but that 's a minor annoyance . \",\n",
       " \"Only the fact that it a McDonald 's is what earns it a 2.5 star . The staff at this location can vary from customer service focused to blatant disregard about anything other than accepting your food order and taking your payment . My last visit wa a combination of the two , when I placed my order an the drive thru intercom , the order wa taken correctly , total given , thanked and asked to drive around to the window . By the time I got around to the window , the person that wa to take my money and give me my food wa way more interested in an argument that wa going on outside in the parking lot between two young lady and the two young men they were with.I 'll admit that I too paid attention to the fight in the parking lot to make sure it did n't escalate into gunfire with my car sitting center mass of it all . About six month ago , someone told me they got robbed while sitting in the drive thru at this location , but they were there around 2am and my visit wa taking place at 6pm , so I wa n't worried about getting robbed a much a I wa about getting shot.After making sure that the parking lot wa not about to be shot up , he accepted my cash , asked me if I wanted to wait a minuite and get some hot fry .

I work late night and when I do get off work if there nothing ready in the house I will stop and my only option is McDonalds or Checkers . Needless to say this is nothing short of `` ghetto '' . I could hear the employee in the background laughing and playing over the intercom a I 'm ordering the food . After I ordered , she did n't even bother to tell me my total or go over my order with me . When I made it to the window she wa having a conversation with her co worker despite me having my hand out the window to give her the money . When I drove up to the second window ... .someone had been smoking a cigarette and threw it right outside the drive-through window . Now I do n't know if it wa maybe a previous customer or and employee but nobody wa in front of me when I pulled up but hard to say . I could hear the music they were playing over my radio in the car and to top it off . Somebody wa calling another chick a `` B*tch '' and just being loud .

Then travel back through the parking lot to your get your Mc-Grub without inconveniencing all the people in car trying to get to work or home.This advice make much more sense than the numbskulls trying to cut through solid traffic just to get some fast food . And for you people who chose to live in `` hidden cove '' next to , and east of , McDonalds ... you have no luck in being able to pull out easily .

It 's super clean inside ( at least when I went ) though we actually had to ask someone where the trashcan wa since it wa hidden around a corner . Ketchup dispenser wa broken and they gave me sweet and sour sauce instead of sweet chili like I asked . Now , I usually do n't review fast food since it 's pretty much the same no matter where you go , but this is the location closest to my house , and I can honestly say I rarely ever go because of one thing ... they are SLOOWWWWWW ! In the drive through , expect to wait around 10+ minute . I even had two people behind me decide to leave after they had ordered , and I wa n't the one holding up the line ! I ordered a Spicy McChicken and nugget . I even considered if going inside would have been faster . Bottom line : this is n't the place to go if you want `` fast . '' \",\n",

       " \"This review is based on the poor service I received in the drive thru last night . I have nothing to say about the food because it 's McDonald 's ... I had a horrible headache and a long drive back from The Woodlands so I just decided to swing through the drive thru to grab some food hoping it would help my headache . There were two car in front of me when I pulled into the line . One car wa at the pick up window , the other wa at the intercom to order . It did n't take long for the car in front of me to order . When it wa my turn , I literally sat there for 3 minute without anyone acknowledging me . Usually if the employee are slow , they will at least say hello and then ask for a moment to help other customer . I wa about to yell into the intercom to make sure they were in fact open . People were pulling up behind me and I wa losing my patience . Finally some lady came on the intercom and said `` What can I get you ? '' As if they were the one waiting on me to decide . I could hear a lot of noise in the background ( sounded chaotic ) . I asked for a grilled chicken wrap . She responded with `` We do n't have grilled meat , wait yeah ok grilled what else ? '' Then I asked for Sprite . `` We 're out of Sprite . '' Ok please give me unsweet ice tea . `` OK Sweet tea . '' At that point , my headache wa so bad I did n't even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea . Then she told me to drive forward without telling me a total . As I 'm waiting to pay and get my food , I see at least two car leave the drive thru line because they 're fed up with the poor service . When I got to the window , the lady even made a comment about it `` Ooooh look at all those car leaving . '' I 'm sorry , but if you are aware that you are losing customer , maybe you should step it up a little bit and get your shit together so you do n't lose customer . She could n't have cared le . It wa pathetic.Luckily I do n't live in that area , so I 'm hoping to never have to experience such slow , horrible service in a drive thru .

Good thing I left some banana on my desk because I ca n't eat this.Oh and the other two time I stopped in for coffee the machine wa broken .

I do like the fact that it 's one of the few in the area that still have an outdoor playground , but the lack of cover for outdoor table make eating outdoors rather unpleasant . All in all , it 's okay , and the convenient location in the neighborhood make it a regular stop . Unfortunately , some of the employee are more interested in chatting with one another than serving customer , and if you have a group of people paying separately but eating together there is an annoying tendency to refuse to take your order at the same time - meaning the first person 's food is cold by the time the last person is served.Edit : I ate at Spicy McChicken Sandwich from the Value Menu around 8pm on 5/17/09 and within hour wa doubled over with food poisoning .

After knocking on the door , a man from inside told me that the dinning room is closed and ask me to use the drive-thru window . Are you kidding me ? Dinning room closed at 8:30 PM ? Needless to say , we left without even ordering . \",\n",

This one out of Terminal B is especially atrocious , even for the mediocre benchmark of McDonalds nationwide . I eventually fled to the adjacent Panchito ( yelp.com/biz/panchitos-m\\x8a\\x97_ ) which wa equally terrible.The service at McDonalds is never particularly outstanding , but when it is , it 's especially worth noting , I just wish this place had it . The woman at the register wa painfully slow , which on airport time can be excruciating . After paying the demon of airport overpricing , we continued to wait and wait ... to the point where I had to ask if our food wa ever coming out.Oh . The fryer 's broken ? Thanks for telling me that awhile ago when I ordered the stuff in the first place . Wait , there are some nugget / fry that are already made ? That doe n't sound particularly appetizing either . But who am I to complain ? This is fast food after all.In the interest of saving time we grab the sack of soggy french fry and crazy hard nugget while I sip on a deflated coke . How doe one screw up a soft drink ? It still managed to happen here . And though I 'm not one to shy away from complaining , it wa already too late . All of these discovery were made while in our plane . Curses . \",\n",

The healthy selection are actually pretty tasty and I love quarter pounder , just hold the cheese.McDonalds are generally consistent . I find most of them are clean and professionally run . This one is an exception . I stopped here for a McMuffin and coffee before my flight . I had a 10:00 AM flight , well past the morning rush . The cooking area of the restaurant were still dirty and the service wa terrible . They had a radio blaring some type of music and personal bag were hanging near the food prep area . The four people working were having trouble handling the two people in line . An employee in uniform ( off-duty I guess ) actually cut IN FRONT of me when I wa in line to get her meal . I complained , but it wa the `` manager '' who handed her the meal . Unreal . I sent a very long email to McDonalds .

Do n't expect service you might at Mark 's , because it is is McDonald 's . However , they do what they can to help get you through the line.I wished that they were open earlier on the weekend , but will say that they have some of the best fountain Diet Coke in the area . \",\n",

McDonald 's food is , well , let 's be charitable and say `` not good '' and leave it there . This is about the restaurant itself . If you go to this one , take a weapon . This is derelict central for every crackheaded wacko in Montrose and that 's a lot of wacko . Sleeping drunk , people loudly arguing with someone only they can see , the `` staring off into space and drooling '' type , the homeless folk having a full-on bath in the restroom sink , and a multitude of those who have a VERY broad interpretation of `` personal hygiene '' . Eating anything from McDonald 's is challenging enough in a vacuum . With the `` regular '' here , it 's more than I can contemplate .

Well besides that they usually have some kind of meal deal , or they recently had for a couple of month free Frappe Fridays ... you tend to see the same face , food is always a ordered , line are long , could be too long , but actually the drive thru move by pretty quickly . like a minute a car and I do n't think that 's bad at all compared to other place . \",\n",

Today when I stopped in the restaurant wa tastefully decorated for Valentine 's Day . The guy next to me ordered and wa given his meal for free if he high five 'd another patron . The employee really enjoyed his reaction and doing something nice for someone . When I paid using my AmEx I wa told that I earn point every time I use that card at McDonald 's and I had enough point to pay for my meal . I know these may seem like small thing but but they put a smile on a lot of people 's face . My day wa happier for having been treated so nicely and I intend to pay it forward .

My daughter wa disgusted with the way they looked . I have no clue how they missed that & had the audacity to place them in a customer 's bag.4 ) They were in a rush to move u along & I had to ask twice for the rest of my order .

This being an experience of course that began with : `` oh man , could n't get across the lane on 59 to get to the usuals '' and had to take a later exit.I am not a total hater on McDonalds , their bacon mcgriddle is perfect for curing the Jose Cuervo , Dos Equis , and Malbec back-alley , no hold barred brawl raging in your stomach - the devil and god raging inside of you that Philosopher Jesse Lacey oft mus upon . The bacon mcgriddle becomes even better if you eat it at an airport or in the middle of a loong roadtrip , it is something like the manifest destineers enjoying their cured and salted meat many mile from home , a mile from typhoid on the Oregon Trail video game , and still a long way away from the Willamette Valley.In this instance , I wa running late and did not have time for my usuals of kolaches and/or bagel and/or breakfast taco , sadface .

Want a bit more ? Better be ready for the glower a the manager put one additional packet on your tray . Oh , the sign that screamed `` no loitering '' wa also a very nice touch . `` That 's not going to be enough ? `` Nope , I 'm going to bathe in it .

       " \"I came here 2 day ago just yesterday morning ( Sunday ) on our family road trip up to Seattle . Being on a busy driving schedule , we did the drive-thru , but wa greatly disappointed at what I got.I think I made a simple order - 2 McChicken sandwich with no mayo for myself and an Oreo McFlurry for my son , and a cup of water . I have ordered McChicken sandwich with no mayo at countless McDonalds for the last 10 year across the US , and they get it right about 95 % + of the time.This time , however , a I started munching on the sandwich while continuing our drive up I-5 , we noticed that BOTH sandwich not only missed the NO mayo request , but BOTH sandwich had DOUBLE mayo , both on top and below the chicken patty . Instead of a NO mayo option , I ended up with a QUADRUPLE mayo-portions for the day . It wa too late to go back and complain and request a correction . I wa too hungry too , so I just ate them both , but felt my heart clogging up for the rest of the afternoon.My order did show up correct on the order confirmation screen in the Drive-Thru window , and the order did print up correctly on my receipt , but the totally incorrect product turned up in my bag unfortunately . I 'll call the feedback number on the receipt to report the incident so they can hopefully figure out where they went wrong.I believe the rest of their operation is probably good , but I am commenting on my specific incident here , which wa my only visit to this McDonald 's . \",\n",
       " 'I come here often because it is very close . While the people there are very nice and helpful i have the same issue . Every time i order it is ALWAYS wrong . ALWAYS . I ordered a chicken wrap plain no cheese crispy . I get lettuce sauce and grilled . I ordered fry and got apple slice . This is just one of many error they make . I would not come here again or recomend it . This is the only location that get my order wrong that many time . ',\n",
       " \"The Sherwood McDonalds , for a long a I 've lived in the area , is probably one of the worst fast-food place I 've been to . Unfortunately , in the interest of convenience and time constraint , we end up running through the drive-thru on rare occasion.Earlier this week they once again met my expectation for being incompetent , apathetic and a waste of money.I ordered a couple meal . 2- 10pc Chicken nugget meal w/ hot mustard and a plain cheeseburger.How many dipping sauce are you supposed to get with the nugget ? 2 per.We got 3 total . 2+2=3 using their new math I guess.1 - plain cheeseburger . I guess at the Sherwood McDonalds that mean you REALLY want a plain chicken sandwich because a chicken sandwich is what we received.Fries - COLD , CHEWY , NO SALT and the one medium fry wa filled half way - I have a picture I 'm attaching.They 've installed visual ordering screen in the drive-thru but they 've managed to completely defeat that failsafe of the customer confirming what they ordered when the staff ca n't manage to pay enough attention to what they are putting in the bags.Do yourself a favor . Do NOT go to this place . I never like to see business fail but in this case it would be doing the paying community a great service . \",\n",

       " \"I apologize ahead of time to the owner for giving bad publicity to this McDonald 's but over the few time I have visited this location , I have not had one good experience . 3 point for the Double K to consider:1 . If a customer asks for a refund after waiting over 25 minute for a 4 piece nugget meal for their kid , your manager should show some sort of logic when dealing with upset people ; maybe asking for the reason why a refund is being requested ; maybe even go so far a to motivate the employee to not spend the majority of their shift texting on their phones.2 . If your staff can not handle the business from the counter AND the drive through at the same time , maybe NOT such a good idea to ADD another drive through lane ; another way to slam the staff with order they can not fill within a reasonable time ! 3 . In the process of remodeling any of your location and there is no regular restaurant seating , a suggestion to accommodate your customer during this temporary situation would be to keep the Play Place seating open until close so customer have a place to eat in.There are many more i could give but here are just a few suggestion from 3 separate visit in hope the reason for this kind of service is due to you guy not knowing what go on in this restaurant . \",\n",

I tried it so you do n't have to . Turns out , the chicken is different . Its moist & the batter is appealing to the eye . But a soon a you get one whiff you know that 's some funky chicken .

I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it wa originally taken early in the year ( mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck . ) So the first time , a the photo show , a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich . I usually order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time , guess what ? It had mayo . I just do n't get why they ca n't read instruction properly or anything . Why ca n't the condiment be separate and not default ? It 's so frustrating . Any way , 2nd time I got the sandwich , they `` got it right '' except for the fly part . I already went in my car so I said `` F it '' so I just took the picture a proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.I did n't go to this location for awhile after this incident , but I wa craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it is n't a fresh produce item or whatever , I decided it would n't be a big deal . Boy wa I wrong . I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nugget and it wa missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal . I should n't have to count how many nugget I have , but sadly these people ca n't do their job . I do n't even get much time to eat lunch so I did n't have time to go back and complain . I 'm done with this location any way so if I 'm craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here , I 'll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably is n't crap like this location . They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job . The fry are a bit overpriced too and some other thing in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries . The best place for that would be the Beaverton location near Uwajimaya off highway 10 ( I think that 's it . ) Conclusion : If you crave McDonalds , don 't go to this location unless you want dead fly in your burgers/sandwiches or missing Chicken McNuggets . \",\n",

We would NEVER go back.Edited to ADD : When you are told to wait so they can `` COOK '' your food to make sure it 's newly made and fresh , they should be able to stand by their word . I wa LIED to , and while i waited an additional few moment , clearly my meal wa not freshly made . It wa STALE and OLD . I realize this is fast food , but the one time I go and request to have food made specifically so I can eat it , they ignore my request , lie to me , and then proceed to charge me for food that wa n't edible . Thank goodness I am a healthy eater , lesson learned . \",\n",

My wife take on fry back because the kid are hungry and okay with any French fry and I take the nugget back and they have a nerve to tell me they are fresh after I have that discussion I tell the lady you need to out my fry also the manager tell her they are fresh and guess what not fresh again overall not so great moment at McDonalds ',\n",

They are so defensive from being yelled that all day long from screwing up . You would think that would be humbling and you would be apologetic to your customer but instead you choose the road of confrontation . What do you expect from somebody who qualifies for the same job a somebody who ha murdered 30 people , just got out of prison , and dropped out of school in the third grade .

Since no one wa standing there , and the car in front of me had moved forward , I moved forward a well.I looked into the second window , and no one wa there either , but it wa blocked off/had a sign to go to the next window . I waited for the car in front of me to move , while still looking back at that first window because I wa 90 % sure the girl that took my order said to go to the next window . Still no sign of anyone.I pulled up to the last window and the girl filling cup did n't acknowledge u . Finally , she opened the window and told another girl to take our debit card . That girl , probably the youngest out of everyone I could see in the back , wa friendly and took our debit card without glaring at u like the rest of the employee . But she took our card somewhere else.Then the manager man came back with our card and pretty much threw it at me without saying anything . The other girl that had n't acknowledged u , but opened the window originally handed u our food and our drinks.I 'm pretty sure they were being rude to u because we had n't paid at the other window , but I 'm pretty sure it 's not the CUSTOMER 'S fault that the EMPLOYEE at the register WAS NOT AT THE REGISTER.Good thing about franchise , especially McDonald 's is that you can go to a different one . If the staff is n't quite a rude a this one , even if they 're still rude , I 'd much rather go anywhere else . So sorry YOU made a mistake , but do n't take it out on u .

       "[\"So it 's fast food and McDonalds at that . So let 's say expectation are very , very low . Sometimes though you just want food that 's fast and you know what to expect . Not every meal can be a 5 star dinner with an executive chef.Even with appropriate low expectation , this location take the cake for subpar service . About a week ago I wa exhausted and needed something to eat and there are few fast food restaurant near where I live . So off to McDonalds I went . Ordered a value meal and a single apple pie . Surprise ... no pie ! Ok , mistake happen . I 've worked drive through in a previous life and I get it . Even though it wa 10 pm and I wa the only car there , so it 's not like they were rushed . Still ... mistake happen.Fast forward to tonight . Again about 10 pm and exhausted and decide to go crazy and get McD 's twice in 1 week . So I try again to order an apple pie with my value meal . Now , maybe this is my fault , because I should have checked the bag before driving off . But after sitting at the window and waiting for 5 minute ( and remember , I wa really tired ) , silly me thought they 'd be able to get it straight this time.Turns out I wa wrong . Yet again ... no pie . Both time ( within a week of each other ) I paid for them . Neither time they felt it necessary to put it in the actual bag.So I called to talk to the manager . And get hung up on a soon a I ask for the manager . So I called back , the manager actually answered and I told him what happened . He did n't sound too displeased , just told me `` next time we 'll get your order right . `` Yeah , if there IS a next time . \",\n",
       " \"I know what your thinking ... . '' another 1 star review for McD 's and you do n't even eat there ? ! ? What give ? '' Well I have to say this is an `` informative '' review ! Getting right down to it . I wa out running by a few client site today when I stopped and picked up lunch at Riverside ( that 's right , be jealous ) . So , a coworker call and asks if I would pick up lunch for her . Being a team player I said no problem . She then told me she wanted Satan ... I mean McDonalds . I sighed , but agreed . She told me what she wanted and off I went . Oh and to get some ketchup and Sweet and Sour sauce . Mkay . I pulled up to the drive thru and ordered after they tried to sell me their new Angus Burger . ( Sidenote : Why do they do that in the first place ? I mean , if that is what I wanted , I would have ordered it . ) `` May I please have # 12 with a Sprite . '' `` Would you l like to add on an apple pie for $ .50 ? '' `` Um , no . '' `` $ 7.01 , please pull up to the first window . '' So I pay . Drive to window # 2 . Man open the window hand me the drink and the bag of food . I asked for a S & S Sauce packet . The guy responded . `` We charge for that now . '' `` Ha , that 's hilarious . Just one please . '' `` No really , they are $ .28 '' `` What ? You 're kidding right ? '' `` No ma'am , if you want one you 'll have to pull back around the drive thru . '' ( Totally dumbfounded I say ) `` Do you charge for ketchup too ? '' Then drive off . I laugh the entire way back to work like a crazy woman ... '' What do you mean your charging for condiment ? `` `` Is it laced with heroin ? '' `` Are there diamond inside these packet ? '' `` Is charging for this even legal ? '' I mean it wa n't even my order and I 'm mad a hell . They 've managed to piss me off again . Congrats McSatan . You officially suck more than ever . Take your Sweet and Sour Sauce and shove it where the sun do n't shine . *spits on ground* \",\n",
       " \"The drive-thru menu board ha changed making it impossible to find the item I usually order . Not sure if it just this location or all McDonalds , anything with mayonnaise will have enough mayo for three sandwich and enough bread for almost 6 sandwich compared to the amount of meat . If you request mustard instead of mayonnaise make sure you ask for mustard at the second window because you 're getting dry sandwich . \",\n",
       " \"Terrible customer service . Rude and indifferent manager . My friend and I go there to purchase food and I asked for a courtesy cup of water a it wa very hot and I did n't want soda . She looked me square in the eye in front of everyone and said `` no '' . That will cost you $ .27 cent . Not even after I had patronized the business could I not have a sip of water ? Really ? I will never shop at that McDonald 's ever again . Any McDonalds really . I actually watched the manager and she treated every minority who walked in like crap . \",\n",
       " \"Definitely not a fan of this McDonald 's . Ordered a Big Mac the other day and the sandwich looked like someone sat on it.I 've seen better quality of sandwich from other location in Dallas . \",\n",
       " \"Check your order ! Yet again they shortchanged me on my large order leaving out one of the big chicken sandwichesDo n't bother calling to fix it a no one answersBy far the worst McDonalds in the area.Update ; Spent 15 minute getting my refund and the manager even shorted me on that . Lesson learned count your change toi \",\n",
       " \"I would n't even give this NASTY place one star ! I went thru the drive-thru and my order wa wrong , because the woman taking my order could hardly speak English . I ordered a McChicken without mayo add mustard and she kept asking me a McChichen add mayo , mustard and onion ? I said no , finally got my order right on the screen pay and then go to get my food and it WRONG ! so I go back thru the line and she apology and I back to the window to get my food for the 2nd time and guess what it wrong again ! I parked my car walked inside and I have no clue where the manager wa but I wa totally grossed out at how nasty this place wa . Not only wa the staff rude but it look like the place had n't been cleaned . This place must be a daycare for all the Mexican kid in the area because they wa running around screaming throwing stuff and just trashing the place out . There wa 3 adult in the whole place and about 20-30 kid just acting a damn mess ! While sitting at my seat I seen what looked like 2 drug deal go one . I saw a tall black man walk in pant hanging off his as and a wife beater ( looked so damn nasty ) he would stand by the door people would pull in a car he would run out to the window trade something off and come back in and stand by the door and then do the same action all over again . When I went to get more soda I noticed there wa no lid ( go figure ) and so I asked the worker he replied to me sorry I am going on break . This store need to be shut down and the owner need to think about what type of place he want representing him . This place should be called El McGhetto because that is all it is . \",\n",
       " \"It 's a pretty dirty McDonald 's , I probably had one two many drink and needed a chocolate shake so I huffed it down to McDonalds . Would I visit McDonalds again ? Unfortunatly ... no matter how disgusted I am with myself after each visit I always come crawling back ... \",\n",
       " \"`` Hello , would you like to try our hot chocolate ? `` Oh man , how I hate the prerecorded message at this drive-thru . NO , I do NOT want the hot chocolate . No , I do NOT want the frappe fizz . NO , I do NOT want whatever piece of crap food item you are happening to push at the present moment ... I DO NOT WANT IT ! I only WANT what I order and what I came in to purchase.When WILL you get that ? In the morning , this is the busiest McDonalds I have ever come across . Usually , there 's a line in the drive-thru snaking into the street . The parking lot is poorly designed , making it difficult to leave once you grab your order . The loop come full circle , and you 're blocked by people in a secondary line entering from Belt Line road northbound.Just give me my freakin ' egg biscuit , cut the high pressure up-selling , and let me get the heck out of here ... \",\n",
       " \"I come here so often for lunch and every time I been here they alway get my order wrong , either I 'm always missing something or I add bacon to a burger and get charged for it and it 's not on a burger I would check and open it up but I do n't have time I have to get back to my job . It 's so aggravating and I ca n't go back around because it would make me late for work I would really hope they do something about this issue ! Either your cook do not know how to read or they so not pay attention . \",\n",
       " \"NO STARS First of all ! ! ! But I am forced to give 1 star.WORST customer service and WORST of all it 's been going on for year and I do n't see any change in service or MANAGEMENT . I live down the street from this location and everytime I place my order I ask them to repeat it but when I get home it 's not correct When I get to the drive thru window it 's like I have to argue with them to present my case to convince to redo the whole order and they only want to replace what they made mistake of the item I ordered not the whole order ! ! ! ! Hell after I have to drive back to the loc for my food to get it correct , I do n't want to eat cold food ... this ha happened to me for year now , I only go to this loc because of my kid . I have complained to Corporate and spoken to the manager but to no avail . After year of bad service and not able to convince my twin I have decided to stop going to this specific location drive 5 mile out of my way to I-30 & 360 McDonald 's location where I get my order from a friendly and smiling person . \",\n",
       " \"`` And on the seventh day , he forsook rest , but opened THE FIRST McDONALDS to quest his famished soul , yea . '' I may be exaggerating on the power of Mickey Ds , but only cause they can sue . Anyway , this particular McDonalds is inside the Wal Mart on Forest Ln. , and form a nice reprieve before or after your purchase . No drive-thru , but there is another McDonalds just down the road , on Abrams , that doe . Anywho , do n't go here often , folk . It 's nice for a forgotten lunch or a celebratory match , but do n't make it a habit . Deuces , doc . \",\n",

The family bathroom doe not have a changing table , it wa totally out of toilet paper , and the hand dryer wa broken . I informed 2 manager of this , but they did nothing to rectify the ( at least ) one issue they could .

How about a clean space and staff that at least pretended to care.This store is close to the house and our grandson wanted his birthday party here.The store had a recent makeover and on first appearance is a very nice location . They obviously spent some money on the makeover . That is why the cleanliness , or lack thereof , wa rather shocking . The dining area by the child 's play area appears to be an afterthought when they are cleaning . I ended up cleaning our table myself since no one seemed to care enough to come wipe down table or throw away trash . The food wa standard fare at McDonald 's but they were really slow filling the order and it wa only lukewarm when we got to the tables.The play area also had one other major issue . They have a little area with animal for the smaller kid to crawl around on . I give them point for that and trying to keep the really wee one away from the bigger kid . I would have thought that someone would have though of affixing the animal in some way so they would not tip over when the kid were on them- a definite safety hazard.Not a store I care to revisit . Luckily my grandson is now 5 and his palate will soon outgrow McDonald 's ! \",\n",

Unfortunately , this mean that at night , during game and practice , the parking lot is mostly full due to people parking there for their games.Do not let the parking lot fool you if there is a game in progress .

The order wa messed up a soon a the person taking the order realized she could n't get me my milkshake , which meant she had over charged our credit card . She had no idea what to do about that and had to get the manager who then acted like it wa my fault and refunded the cash for one milkshake . However , there were two ordered and two charged so she had to then refund more cash - these milkshake cost over three additional buck over the normal price of the meal we ordered that included drink - I know confusing . So after refunding the cash - I asked what I could get to drink and she said that would cost more - there wa no drink that would come with my meal ? ? ? ?

Our order wa simple , but we had to repeat it multiple time in response to `` Whaaa ? '' coming from the order box . Then , when the voice from the box repeated our order , it wa wrong ! Then , when we went to the pay window , they asked if our order wa correct and it absolutely wa n't ! Then , when we went to the food window , we asked for ketchup and were told it wa in the bag . We dug in , found no ketchup but a TON of salt packet . Luckily , my boyfriend is a ketchup hoarder , so we had a bunch of little packet on hand . Overall , the debacle started off comically difficult and ended up disappointing and a bit enraging . Mostly , I wa mad because we were lied to ! The ketchup wa a lie ! ! Now , I ca n't lie . I 'll probably be back , because my expectation for McD 's are n't too high and I like french fry . \",\n",
       " \"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SHAMROCK SHAKE ONLYIt 's brighter green than I remember . An extremely unnatural shade of green that doe n't occur normally in nature . For a unnatural the color is , the flavor is just a fake . I do n't think there is any actual mint or dairy in these thing . I think they are petroluem-based.Does it taste different than it used to ? Definitely . A few year ago , McD 's did the unthinkable . They ditched their old shake recipe for a new faster/cheaper/easier shake `` system '' . Basically , a neutral vanilla shake come out and different flavored syrup are mixed in at the last minute . The result is a sub-par product . Syrupy and too sweet . It 's not even mixed when it come out . It 's like those thousand-flavor ice cream joint that do the flavor syrup . YUKIs the Shamrock Shake disgusting ? YESDo I kind of love it ? YESThe shake do n't taste TOO horribly different . They are similar enough to the old recipe to still be OK in my book . Do I feel dirty for eating one ? YESDo I now want to vomit ? YESWould I recommend the Shamrock Shake to the casual observer ? TOTALLY \",\n",
       " \"This review scream `` First World Problems '' ... but until Yelp open up a site that allows u to review establishment in the `` Third World '' ( can one even still use that term without being offensive ? ) , I guess all of the thing about which we gripe will be `` First World Problems , '' wo n't they ? Anyhow , my wife wa hungry one evening so we stopped here to grab a bite to eat through the drive-thru . We actually enjoy eating at McDonald 's in general and think the food is good ( some people will probably find that statement more offensive than the above comment about terminology ! ) , so it 's not like this wa a bad option . We actually used to stop at this one pretty often on our way home from church when we lived on the East Side and we generally received great service.Unfortunately , tonight wa a night on which we received awful service.When we pulled up to the drive-through , the McDonald 's employee let loose with this rapid-fire barrage that wa presumably supposed to tell u what food wa n't available . I 'm a teacher , and I 'm used to deciphering ... but this wa incomprehensible . Of course , when we mistakingly ordered something that wa deemed off-limits , we were made to feel like buffoons.After we finally managed to figured out what wa available , we ordered and pulled up to the window . You do n't need a crystal ball to figure out what happened next -- that 's right , they got the order partially wrong . One of my wife 's Chicken McNuggets even wound up outside of the container . Perhaps it wa in a hurry to escape an environment completely void of any sort of concern for the customer , or perhaps they could n't be bothered to take an extra second to close the container fully . I 'll let you be the judge on that one . They also gave her the wrong sauce . I had no idea that `` Sweet and Sour '' actually mean `` Barbeque . `` Why we stopped at this McDonald 's instead of driving to the McDonald 's on Clark -- which consistently provides amazing customer service that surely make Ray Kroc smile in his grave -- is beyond me . Live and learn . \",\n",
       " \"They open at 5am so I wa the first in line today . I gave my order loud and clear , the cashier responded but the speaker wa so quiet I could not understand . I went to the 1st window which had a sign saying hearing impaired could get assistance at that window , but no one wa present . A few employee walked by , barely looking at me . Finally one waved for me to go to the 2nd window ( notice there wa no sign on the 1st window ? ) . When I got to the 2nd window , the woman who took my order said she had n't gotten it . At that point I wa ready to leave , but I repeated it and waited several more minute to get my order . At 509am I had my 2 bacon egg and cheese muffin with a hash brown . I gave them the 2 star because the bagged the order correctly . \",\n",
       " \"When I think of McDonald 's , I generally think of a pretty tightly ran ship and expediency.Something is horribly wrong with this Mcdonalds . Severely long wait time at the drive thru . A couple week ago they were n't even taking order via the intercom . You literally had to wait your turn to get to the 2nd window before placing your order , then they had you wait right there at the window until they fulfilled the order . Do you know what this doe to business ? ! Cars were driving off without completing their orders.I just now attempted to go through just for a coffee . Few car in line but again ... loooonnnng wait time . I finally got to the intercom and before I could even place my coffee order , the woman blurts out that they do n't currently have any fries.Seriously ? ! This is flippin McDonald 's ? I placed my coffee order then started the long wait . After a few minute and no movement of the car ahead , I pulled on out of there and went across the street to the whopper king . I do believe from what I have seen going on there over the past couple of month , that unless there is a corporate intervention ... and soon ... this place is a sinking ship with no life boat . \",\n",

I literally waited 15 minute in line on two different ocassions . So , just today when I visited , I thought , `` Hmm . I 'll be smart this time . I 'll go inside to beat the line drive-through line wrapping around the building . '' Well , I should have known better . Inside , the line snaked to the door ; just two foot from where I entered the restaurant .

In fact , there were still five people in front of me ! Frustrated and hating myself for giving this place yet another shot , I left without food and vowed NEVER TO RETURN.THE SUM-IT-UP : I really do n't like McDonalds that much , but I do think that they seem pretty well-run overall .
